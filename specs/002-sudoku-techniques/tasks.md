# Tasks: Sudoku Technique Teaching & Analysis System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-sudoku-techniques/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Test-First Development is MANDATORY per Constitution Principle III. All tests must be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single project structure: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- TypeScript 5.9.3 with strict mode
- Svelte 5 components
- Vitest for unit/integration tests

---

- [ ] T004 Add SolvingTechnique interface to src/models/technique.ts with all metadata fields

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion (can run in parallel with US1 if staffed)
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 and US2 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but builds on US1's technique infrastructure

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1**:
- Tests (T014-T019) MUST FAIL before implementation
- Beginner techniques (T020-T025) in parallel ‚Üí then services (T026-T032) sequentially ‚Üí then UI (T033-T037) in parallel

**User Story 2**:
- Tests (T043-T045) MUST FAIL before implementation
- All techniques (T046-T081) in parallel ‚Üí then services (T082-T086) sequentially ‚Üí then UI (T087-T091) in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T002, T003 can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: T007, T008 can run in parallel
- **US1 Tests**: T014, T015, T016, T017, T018, T019 can all run in parallel
- **US1 Techniques**: T020-T025 (6 beginner techniques) can all run in parallel
- **US1 UI**: T033, T034 can run in parallel
- **US2 Tests**: T043, T044, T045 can all run in parallel
- **US2 Techniques**: T046-T081 (36 techniques) can all run in parallel - MASSIVE parallelization opportunity
- **US2 UI**: T087-T090 can all run in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Techniques

```bash
# Launch all 6 beginner technique implementations together:
Task T020: "Implement HiddenSingles in src/techniques/HiddenSingles.ts"
Task T021: "Implement NakedPairs in src/techniques/NakedPairs.ts"
Task T022: "Implement NakedTriples in src/techniques/NakedTriples.ts"
Task T023: "Implement HiddenPairs in src/techniques/HiddenPairs.ts"
Task T024: "Implement PointingPairs in src/techniques/PointingPairs.ts"
Task T025: "Implement NakedQuads in src/techniques/NakedQuads.ts"

# All different files, no dependencies - can run simultaneously
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 Techniques

```bash
# Launch all 36 intermediate/advanced/expert techniques together:
# T046-T081 can ALL run in parallel (36 different files)
# This is the largest parallelization opportunity in the project
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T013) - CRITICAL checkpoint
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T042)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently with hints at all three levels
5. Deploy/demo MVP - users can now learn techniques through progressive hints!

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): T001-T013 ‚Üí Infrastructure ready
2. **MVP** (Phase 3): T014-T042 ‚Üí Hint system functional ‚úÖ Deploy
3. **Full Feature** (Phase 4): T043-T093 ‚Üí Technique library ‚úÖ Deploy
4. **Production Ready** (Phase 5): T094-T106 ‚Üí Polish + validation ‚úÖ Final deploy

Each phase adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 hints (T014-T042)
- **Developer B-F**: User Story 2 techniques in batches (T046-T081) - 36 techniques, ~7 per developer
- **Developer G**: User Story 2 UI (T087-T091) - can start after US1 foundation

---

## Notes

- **TDD is MANDATORY**: All test tasks must FAIL before implementation per Constitution Principle III
- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability
- **Technique parallelization**: 40 total techniques, only 6 needed for MVP (US1)
- **File paths**: All paths are absolute from repository root
- **Type safety**: Strict TypeScript mode enforced, no `any` types (Constitution Principle VI)
- **Performance targets**: <2s analysis (FR-008), <500ms hints (FR-009)
- **Existing code**: PuzzleGenerator.ts, GameValidator.ts, StorageService.ts remain unchanged (FR-005)
- Each user story independently testable per acceptance criteria
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 106 (reduced from 112)
- **Setup Phase**: 4 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 9 tasks
- **User Story 1 (MVP)**: 29 tasks (6 tests + 21 implementation + 2 validation)
- **User Story 2**: 51 tasks (3 tests + 48 implementation)
- **Polish Phase**: 13 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 6 beginner techniques (US1)
- 36 intermediate/advanced/expert techniques (US2)
- Multiple test suites
- Multiple UI components

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 only (42 tasks) ‚Üí Hint system fully functional with validation

**Full Feature Scope**: Phases 1-4 (93 tasks) ‚Üí Hint system + Technique library

**Removed from Scope**:
- Practice mode for specific techniques (originally T044, T086-T088, T092)
- User satisfaction metrics (SC-005, SC-007)
- Technique-based difficulty classification (FR-006)
